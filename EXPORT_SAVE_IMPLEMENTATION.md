# Export and Save Functionality Implementation

## Overview

A comprehensive export and save system has been implemented for the drawing application, allowing users to export their drawings as images and save/load their work as JSON files.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Image Export

- **Formats**: PNG, JPG, SVG
- **Options**:
  - Quality control for JPG (10-100%)
  - Scale factor (1x, 2x, 4x) for higher resolution
  - Background color selection (transparent, white, custom)
- **Output**: Downloads images to user's default download folder

### 2. Data Persistence

- **Save**: Export canvas elements as JSON file
- **Load**: Import previously saved JSON files
- **Auto-save**: Automatic saving to localStorage during drawing

### 3. User Interface

- **Export Modal**: Comprehensive UI for selecting export options
- **Dropdown Menu**: Easy access to all file operations
- **Toast Notifications**: User feedback for all operations
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - `Ctrl+S`: Save drawing
  - `Ctrl+O`: Load drawing
  - `Ctrl+Shift+E`: Export image

## File Structure

### Core Utilities

- **`/utils/export.ts`**: Main export functionality
  - `exportCanvasAsImage()`: Handles PNG, JPG, SVG export
  - `saveCanvasAsJSON()`: Saves drawing data as JSON
  - `loadCanvasFromJSON()`: Loads drawing data from JSON
  - Helper functions for element bounds calculation

### UI Components

- **`/components/custom/modals/ExportModal.tsx`**: Export options UI
  - Format selection
  - Quality and scale controls
  - Background color options
  - Real-time preview information

### State Management

- **`/utils/canvasState.ts`**: DOM-based canvas state access
  - `getCanvasElement()`: Gets canvas DOM element
  - `getCanvasElements()`: Gets drawing elements from localStorage
  - `getCanvasViewport()`: Gets viewport position and scale
  - `setCanvasElements()`: Updates drawing elements

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **`/hooks/useKeyboardShortcuts.ts`**: Reusable keyboard shortcut hook
  - Handles Ctrl/Cmd key combinations
  - Prevents default browser behavior
  - Customizable callback functions

## Integration Points

### Left3bar Component

- Updated to use canvas state utilities instead of prop drilling
- Implements all file operations (save, load, export)
- Includes keyboard shortcuts and toast notifications
- Self-contained with no external dependencies

### CanvasBoard Component

- Added event listener for external canvas updates
- Responds to 'canvas-elements-updated' custom events
- Maintains existing drawing and collaboration functionality

### Main Application

- **App.tsx**: Includes Toaster component for notifications
- **PlayGround.tsx**: Simplified component structure without prop passing

## Usage Instructions

### Export Image

1. Click hamburger menu (☰) in top-left corner
2. Select "Export image..." or press `Ctrl+Shift+E`
3. Choose format (PNG/JPG/SVG)
4. Set quality and scale options
5. Select background color
6. Click "Export" to download

### Save Drawing

1. Click hamburger menu (☰) or press `Ctrl+S`
2. Select "Save to..."
3. Choose location and filename
4. Drawing data saved as JSON file

### Load Drawing

1. Click hamburger menu (☰) or press `Ctrl+O`
2. Select "Load from..."
3. Choose previously saved JSON file
4. Drawing will replace current canvas content

## Technical Details

### Export Process

1. Gets canvas element and drawing data from DOM/localStorage
2. Calculates element bounds for optimal export size
3. Creates temporary canvas for rendering
4. Renders all elements using rough.js
5. Exports in selected format with specified options

### State Synchronization

1. Uses DOM-based access to avoid React prop drilling complexity
2. Custom events trigger re-renders when data is imported
3. localStorage serves as single source of truth for drawing data

### Error Handling

- Validates canvas availability before operations
- Provides user-friendly error messages via toast notifications
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data or failed operations

## Browser Compatibility

- Supports modern browsers with Canvas API
- File download using HTML5 download attribute
- File picker using HTML5 file input element
- Keyboard events with proper cross-platform key detection

## Future Enhancements

- Batch export of multiple formats
- Cloud storage integration
- Drawing templates and presets
- Export to additional formats (PDF, etc.)
- Collaborative real-time saving
